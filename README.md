# OB Freie

Old Babylonian Freie - A font made for the Institut für Altorientalistik Berlin, based on aBZL.
The current version is _v.1.1_ (6. April 2024)

_Other font-formats (woff2 and ttf and versions without the Latin characters) will be added shortly._

## Quick Guide

Follow [this download link for the latest version](https://github.com/crzfub/OB-Freie/releases/latest/download/OBFreie.zip) or navigate to the releases to pick a different version.
Extract the archive and click the file ending as '.otf' twice. This opens your systems native dialogue for adding fonts. Follow the on-screen instructions.

(Microsoft Office Programs need to be reopened for the fonts to load.)

For writing Cuneiform Characters I would advise to use the [Enmerkar Keylayout by Robin Leroy](https://github.com/eggrobin/Enmerkar) or if that doesn't work on your system [NesiliKeys by Rolf Noyer](https://www.hethport.uni-wuerzburg.de/cuneifont/).

### A Word of Warning ⚠️

<!-- Small explanation of the current limitations of this font. -->

For now the font is optimised for the 'Light' weight. The 'Regular' and 'Bold' weights were derived through algorithms from the 'Light' weight. Hence they are labeled 'experimental'. Yet in print at sizes such as 12pt you might find 'Regular' more readable than 'Light' without much loss in detail. Until the redraw is completed some signs will be unusable in print at large sizes (i.e. for posters), this effect is worse in 'Regular' and 'Light'.

## Roadmap

(subject to change)

- [ ] _v-1.3_ - add all variants that have unique codepoints <!--[^1] -->
- [ ] _v-1.5_ - complete the redraw for 'OBFreie Light'
- [ ] _v-2.0_ - complete redraw for 'OBFreie Regular' & 'OBFreie Bold'
- [ ] _v-3.0_ - include all variants as 'ss0n' features

<!-- [^1]: In *aBZL* some signs share an entry that can be divided into two codepoints. #FIXME Give the example one that is already added. If I can find it again. -->

## SVGs

<!-- #TODO:Rename ligatures to u123123u200du222222 etc. -->

The _svg_ files are automatically named to their respective _Unicode_ codepoints. I checked some of them, however I did not make the effort to check all of them by hand. Signs that from the _'ss01'_ table have the table's name appended. <!-- #TODO maybe footnote with link/explanation of ss01 --> Unlike the font itself the _svgs_ are licensed through CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.
Due to the slightly cumbersome process of generating SVGs for an open type font - I only plan to update these on major releases for now.

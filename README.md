#TODO: Create Folders: SVG and Fonts
#TODO: Create a Short Manual
#TODO: Implement Licenses -- CC.BY.SA.4 for the SVGs and OFL for the Fonts; Both als License Files in the project.

## ⚠️ A word of warning 
<!-- Small explanation of the current limitations of this font. -->
For now the font is most optimised in the 'Light' weight. The 'Regular' and 'Bold' weights were derived through algorithms from the 'Light' weight. Hence they are labeled 'experimental'. Yet in print at sizes such as 12pt you might find 'Regular' more readable than 'Light'. Until the redraw is completed you might find some signs unusable in print at large sizes (i.e. for posters).

however - change the "Github" thing to refubium and include doi if we get one?

# Roadmap
(subject to change)
- [ ] *v-1.3* - add variants that have unique codepoints
- [ ] *v-1.5* - complete the redraw for 'OBFreie Light' 
- [ ] *v-2.0* - complete redraw for 'OBFreie Regular' & 'OBFreie Bold'
- [ ] *v-3.0* - include all variants as 'ss0n' feature

# SVGs
<!-- FIXME:Rename ligatures to u123123u200du222222 etc. -->
 The *svg* files are automatically named to their respective *Unicode* codepoints. I checked some of them, however I did not make the effort to check all of them by hand. Signs that are from the *'ss01'* table have the table's name appended. <!-- #FIXME make footnote with link/explanation of ss01 --> Unlike the font itself the *svgs* are licensed through CC BY-NC-SA 4.0. 
 Due to the slightly cumbersome process of generating SVGs for an open type font - I only plan to update these on major releases for now.

If a sign is missing, attached to the wrong codepoint, you need a small number of signs in higher quality, or have any other problem/idea. Feel free to open an *issue* through Github or mail me at ...

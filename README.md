<!-- Short Explanation, #FIXME take the one from the Font Description-->
# OB Freie
Old Babylonian Freie - A font made for the Institut für Altorientalistik Berlin, based on aBZL. 
The current version is *v.1.1* (6. April 2024)

<!-- PLANS: 
#TODO: Create Folders: SVG and Fonts
#TODO: Create a Short Manual
#TODO: Implement Licenses -- CC.BY.SA.4 for the SVGs and OFL for the Fonts; Both als License Files in the project. 
#TODO: Add DOI and ORCID if I get both these things
The short manual has to be: 
How to download
How to install 
What you shouldn't use it for

# Quick Guide 
<!-- Go to release (IMAGE) download, select and double-click. For an extensive Documentation of the making of the font go to refubium/opendanes/doi whatever!

 -->
Follow [this download link for the latest version](https://github.com/crzfub/OB-Freie/releases/latest/download/OBFreie.zip) or navigate to the releases to pick a different version. 
Extract the archive and click the file ending as '.otf' twice. This opens your systems native dialogue for adding fonts. Follow the on-screen instructions. 

(Microsoft Office Programs need to be reopened for the fonts to load.) 
<!-- As a keylayout I would advise to use Enmerkar. Alternatively there is also #FIXME ADD LINK  nesilikeys.-->

For writing Cuneiform Characters I would advise to use the [Enmerkar Keylayout by Robin Leroy](https://github.com/eggrobin/Enmerkar) or if that doesn't work on your system [NesiliKeys by Rolf Noyer](https://www.hethport.uni-wuerzburg.de/cuneifont/). 

## A Word of Warning ⚠️
<!-- Small explanation of the current limitations of this font. -->
For now the font is optimised for the 'Light' weight. The 'Regular' and 'Bold' weights were derived through algorithms from the 'Light' weight. Hence they are labeled 'experimental'. Yet in print at sizes such as 12pt you might find 'Regular' more readable than 'Light'. Until the redraw is completed some signs will be unusable in print at large sizes (i.e. for posters), this effect is worse in 'Regular' and 'Light'. 

<!-- ## Cite like this -->
<!-- give a citation example in a code-block, maybe a .bib file? think about that! #TODO bibfile once I have a DOI and everything -->

<!-- # Version History: v.1.1 -->

<!-- create this bib file: 
@misc{Ziegeler_2024, title={OB Freie}, url={https://github.com/crzfub/OB-Freie/}, journal={Github}, publisher={Institut für Altorientalistik - Freie Universität Berlin}, author={Ziegeler, Corvin Richard}, year={2024}, month={Apr}} 

and add this: MLA9
Ziegeler, Corvin Richard. “OB Freie.” *Github*, v.1.1, Institut Für Altorientalistik - Freie Universität Berlin, 6 Apr. 2024, https://github.com/crzfub/OB-Freie/. 

however - change the "Github" thing to refubium and include doi if we get one?

# Roadmap
(subject to change)
- [ ] *v-1.3* - add variants that have unique codepoints
- [ ] *v-1.5* - complete the redraw for 'OBFreie Light' 
- [ ] *v-2.0* - complete redraw for 'OBFreie Regular' & 'OBFreie Bold'
- [ ] *v-3.0* - include all variants as 'ss0n' feature

# SVGs
<!-- FIXME:Rename ligatures to u123123u200du222222 etc. -->
 The *svg* files are automatically named to their respective *Unicode* codepoints. I checked some of them, however I did not make the effort to check all of them by hand. Signs that are from the *'ss01'* table have the table's name appended. <!-- #FIXME make footnote with link/explanation of ss01 --> Unlike the font itself the *svgs* are licensed through CC BY-NC-SA 4.0. 
 Due to the slightly cumbersome process of generating SVGs for an open type font - I only plan to update these on major releases for now.
